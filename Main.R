#a) Generate a simulated data set with 20 observations in each of three classes (i.e. 60
#observations total), and 50 variables

#vectors, rather than on the raw data. That is, perform K-means clustering on the 60 Ã— 2

#second column is the second principal component score vector. Comment on the
#results.
